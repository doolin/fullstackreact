      This is not going to work from localhost, it results in an
      error "origin 'null' has been blocked by CORS policy." See
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53042123/can-babel-standalone-be-used-if-index-html-is-served-locally-no-webserver
      for more details.
      
      Options going forward from here include:
      1. compiling everything locally first;
      2. serving the file via webserver of some sort.

      Marching along with option 2 first:
      * sudo apachectl start
      * from ~/public_html: ln -s ~/src/fullstackreact/jsx/basic/ jsx
      * http://http://localhost/~doolin/jsx/index1.html

      This resulted in an error:
      `DOMException: Failed to read the 'ready' property from ServiceWorkerContainer`
      which may be a load path problemm, or something else.
